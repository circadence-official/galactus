# `/deployments`

This directory holds the configurations for deploying the application. Mainly it consists of Helm charts and values files for Kubernetes deployments of the backend microservices that reside within `/services`. However, more can go here such as configurations for AWS Lambda functions that reside within `/functions` or configurations for client deployments as well.
